# Project 4: Around The U.S.

## Creating a responsive & interactive web page where users can add, remove, or like photos.

### Project Description and its Functionality:

HTML page, styled by CSS, and Connected Third-Party Code including Fonts.  
The web page contains templates, forms, popups, images, buttons and grid layouts.
JS code sets its behavior - activation and validation of forms, Importing content using HTML templates, and control popups functionality which is triggered by pressing keys or clicking buttons/windows.

### Technologies Description and Used Techniques:
* Creating popups and managing their display, which helps to create a much better UX/UI.
Coding some features which allow the users to close popups by clicking on the overlay or by pressing the Esc key.
* Implementing instant form validation by instantly checking and responding to user inputs:
 user-friendly customizing for easier and pleasant users interaction on the Client-side.
 Verification of the correct format data input and the process-server safety on the Server-side.
* Working with the standard browser methods as well as methods crafted using custom JavaScript, with the assistance of regular expressions.
* Positioning elements using Flexbox, Grid layoutsÂ and Grid Areas to create adaptive and responsive web-page which change depending on the width of the browser window, avoiding horizontal scrolling, and allow using different devices.
For Optimizing responsiveness I used Media Queries, The Fr Unit, Meta Tags, the calc() Function
* I used prefixes where in special layout or borders to maintain the code mobility.
* I used css to cut off input text that doesn't fit to avoid Block Overflow.
* Optimizing exported images and svg files using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) To Maximize the fast of the loading.
* I organized all the files according to BEM structure using the @import Rule, and Connected the Necessary Blocks to the Web Page, to achieve maximum Code mobility.
* I used the command-line to work with git by creating & merging branches & writing some perfect commits.
To be honest, I thought all the code I wrote is gone forever, but after dealing with some conflicts I was able to restore it through another branch. After a mini heart-attack I felt like a git expert :)
* I used the chrome dev-tools for Debugging.

* I used Figma for guidelines:
