# Project 4: Around The U.S.

## Creating a responsive & interactive web page where users can add, remove, or like photos.

### Project Description and its Functionality:

HTML page, styled by CSS, and Connected Third-Party Code including Fonts.  
The web page contains images, buttons, and grid layouts.
JS code is set its behavior, which triggered by clicking buttons.


### Technologies Description and Used Techniques:

* Positioning elements using Flexbox, Grid layoutsÂ and Grid Areas to create adaptive and responsive web-page which change depending on the width of the browser window, avoiding horizontal scrolling, and allow using different devices.
For Optimizing responsiveness I used Media Queries, The Fr Unit, Meta Tags, the calc() Function
* I used prefixes where in special layout or borders to maintain the code mobility.
* I used css to cut off input text that doesn't fit to avoid Block Overflow.
* Optimizing exported images and svg files using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) To Maximize the fast of the loading.
* I organized all the files according to BEM structure using the @import Rule, and Connected the Necessary Blocks to the Web Page, to achieve maximum Code mobility.
* I was used the command-line to work with git by creating and merging branches and writing some perfect commits.
Resourcefulness - I thought I had lost forever all the code I wrote, but I was able to recover it through another branch. After a mini heart attack I felt like a git expert :)
* I used the chrome dev-tools for Debugging.

* I used Figma for guidelines:
